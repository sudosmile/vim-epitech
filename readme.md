# vim-epitech Sudosmile fork
vim plugin for epitech students

## Fork diff :
I chose to remove everything that wasn't the header, because most of the other
features of this plugin are already available with simple vimrc options.
Also made char above 80 cols highlighted instead of always showing col 80


## features
* adds epitech header following the new header style (promotion 2023 and later)

## install
use your favorite plugin manager. if you don't use one, i recommand
[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), it's very simple to use.

## usage
run `:TekAddHeader` in normal mode to run the plugin, and enter a description
for your file (or some text will be put instead).

the epitech header will be then put at the top of your file.
